## What Works
*   **Mobile-optimized responsive design** with proper viewport settings and touch controls
*   **Enhanced UI/UX** with responsive text sizing, mobile-friendly buttons, and improved layouts
*   **Comprehensive game states** - Main menu with instructions, game over screen with performance feedback
*   **Touch-friendly controls** - Larger buttons on mobile, proper touch areas, optimized for mobile devices
*   **Professional page layout** with gradient background, proper header/footer, and mobile hints
*   Core gameplay loop: bird jumps, falls with gravity, collides with pipes/bounds.
*   Procedurally generated pipes spawn and scroll.
*   Scoring system implemented, increments on passing pipes.
*   High score saved to and loaded from `localStorage`.
*   Basic game over state (physics pause, bird tint) on collision.
*   Asset preloading (`PreloaderScene`).
*   Phaser game instance integrated into a Next.js React component.
*   Project setup (Next.js, TS, Tailwind, ESLint, Prettier).

## What's Left
*   **Phase 4.3: Sound System** (SKIPPED - can be added later when audio assets are available)
    *   Background music, sound effects, audio controls
*   **Phase 6: Testing and Optimization**
    *   Unit, integration, e2e tests.
    *   Performance optimization (asset loading, code splitting, etc.).
    *   Bug fixing and final polish.
*   **Phase 7: Deployment and Launch**
    *   Build configuration, Vercel deployment, monitoring, analytics.
*   Further work on Phase 2: Game Assets (backgrounds, UI elements, sound effects, music - user dependent).

## Current Status
Phase 5 (UI and User Experience) COMPLETED with comprehensive mobile optimization. Ready for Phase 6 (Testing & Optimization) or Phase 7 (Deployment).

## Known Issues / Blockers
*   No sound effects or music (Phase 4.3 skipped).
*   Full suite of game assets (backgrounds, more UI elements, SFX) still needed from user for a complete experience.
*   May need performance testing on various mobile devices.
