## What Works
*   **âœ… PRODUCTION-READY DEPLOYMENT**: Optimized build config, Vercel deployment setup, PWA features
*   **âœ… Build System**: Next.js 15 optimized config, proper ES modules, successful production builds
*   **âœ… Performance**: 103KB bundle size, optimized caching, security headers, PWA manifest
*   **âœ… Documentation**: Comprehensive deployment guide, maintenance procedures, performance targets
*   **Mobile-optimized responsive design** with proper viewport settings and touch controls
*   **Enhanced UI/UX** with responsive text sizing, mobile-friendly buttons, and improved layouts
*   **Comprehensive game states** - Main menu with instructions, game over screen with performance feedback
*   **Touch-friendly controls** - Larger buttons on mobile, proper touch areas, optimized for mobile devices
*   **Professional page layout** with gradient background, proper header/footer, and mobile hints
*   Core gameplay loop: bird jumps, falls with gravity, collides with pipes/bounds.
*   Procedurally generated pipes spawn and scroll.
*   Scoring system implemented, increments on passing pipes.
*   High score saved to and loaded from `localStorage`.
*   Basic game over state (physics pause, bird tint) on collision.
*   Asset preloading (`PreloaderScene`).
*   Phaser game instance integrated into a Next.js React component.
*   Project setup (Next.js, TS, Tailwind, ESLint, Prettier).

## What's Left
*   **Phase 7.2: FINAL DEPLOYMENT**: Deploy to Vercel platform and verify live functionality
*   **Phase 7.3: Post-Launch**: Monitor performance, analytics setup, maintenance documentation
*   **Phase 4.3: Sound System** (OPTIONAL - can be added later when audio assets are available)
    *   Background music, sound effects, audio controls

## Current Status
**READY FOR DEPLOYMENT!** Phase 7.1 (Deployment Preparation) COMPLETED. All build optimizations done, configuration files created, production build tested successfully. Ready for live deployment to Vercel.

## Deployment Ready Features
*   âœ… **Optimized Build**: Next.js 15, ES modules, 103KB bundle size
*   âœ… **PWA Support**: Installable game, offline capability, mobile optimization
*   âœ… **Security**: Headers, HTTPS, secure deployment configuration
*   âœ… **Performance**: Caching strategy, asset optimization, responsive design
*   âœ… **Mobile-First**: Touch controls, responsive UI, device detection
*   âœ… **Documentation**: Complete deployment guide and maintenance procedures

## Known Issues / Blockers
*   No sound effects or music (Phase 4.3 skipped).
*   Full suite of game assets (backgrounds, more UI elements, SFX) still needed from user for a complete experience.
*   May need performance testing on various mobile devices.
