## What Works
*   Core gameplay loop: bird jumps, falls with gravity, collides with pipes/bounds.
*   Procedurally generated pipes spawn and scroll.
*   Scoring system implemented, increments on passing pipes.
*   High score saved to and loaded from `localStorage`.
*   Basic game over state (physics pause, bird tint) on collision.
*   Asset preloading (`PreloaderScene`).
*   Phaser game instance integrated into a Next.js React component.
*   Project setup (Next.js, TS, Tailwind, ESLint, Prettier).

## What's Left
*   **Phase 4: Game Features and Polish**
    *   Start Screen, Game Over Screen, Pause functionality, Restart mechanism.
    *   Visual Effects (particles, screen shake, transitions).
    *   Sound System (background music, SFX, controls).
*   **Phase 5: UI and User Experience**
    *   Main Menu design, game instructions, settings menu, difficulty selection.
    *   Enhanced Game UI elements (beyond current score display).
    *   Responsive Design and mobile compatibility.
*   **Phase 6: Testing and Optimization**
    *   Unit, integration, e2e tests.
    *   Performance optimization (asset loading, code splitting, etc.).
    *   Bug fixing and final polish.
*   **Phase 7: Deployment and Launch**
    *   Build configuration, Vercel deployment, monitoring, analytics.
*   Further work on Phase 2: Game Assets (backgrounds, UI elements, sound effects, music - user dependent).

## Current Status
Core game mechanics (Phase 3) are functional. Moving to Phase 4: Game Features and Polish, starting with game states (Start/Game Over screens).

## Known Issues / Blockers
*   No actual Start Menu or Game Over screen yet; game starts directly and ends abruptly.
*   Visuals are basic (placeholder bird, procedural pipes, simple text for score).
*   No sound effects or music.
*   Full suite of game assets (backgrounds, more UI elements, SFX) still needed from user for a complete experience.
