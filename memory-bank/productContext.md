# Product Context – Why Shoppy Bird v2 Exists

## Problem / Opportunity
Casual web games drive engagement, dwell-time, and social sharing.
Re-building a well-known mechanic with today's web stack is an ideal showcase for:
• Modern React patterns (Next.js 14 App Router)
• Seamless game engine integration (Phaser 3 in React)
• Rapid, zero-ops cloud deployment (Vercel)

## Target Users
• Casual gamers looking for a quick challenge
• Developers seeking reference architecture for React + Phaser
• Hiring managers evaluating engineering craft

## How It Should Work
1. User lands on the root URL → sees a crisp hero menu.
2. Press "Start" → game canvas fades in, the bird idles.
3. Single tap / click or space-bar → bird jumps; gravity & pipes begin.
4. Score increments on each pipe pair; collisions trigger game-over screen.
5. High score persists via localStorage; share buttons encourage virality.

## User-Experience Goals
• One-tap controls, instant retry, snappy feedback
• Polished visuals & audio cues
• Seamless transition between menu, gameplay, and game-over states
• Mobile-first layout with responsive, touch-friendly UI
