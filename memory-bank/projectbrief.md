# Project Brief – Shoppy Bird v2

## Overview
Shoppy Bird v2 is a modern, web-based re-imagining of the classic "Flappy Bird" mechanic.
Built with Next.js 14 and Phaser 3, it delivers an engaging mini-game that showcases strong front-end engineering practices and polished game-feel on both desktop and mobile.

## Core Goals
1. Deliver a smooth, responsive, and fun gameplay experience.
2. Demonstrate an end-to-end React / TypeScript project that integrates a real-time game engine.
3. Provide clean, maintainable, and well-tested code that others can learn from.
4. Achieve a production-ready deployment to Vercel in ≤ 20 days of effort.

## Project Scope
The roadmap defines seven sequential phases:
1. **Project Setup & Basic Structure**
2. **Game Assets & Resources**
3. **Core Game Mechanics**
4. **Game Features & Polish**
5. **UI & User Experience**
6. **Testing & Optimization**
7. **Deployment & Launch**

## Timeline & Phases
| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | 1-2 days | Next.js TS project, Tailwind, Phaser, CI setup |
| 2 | 2-3 days | All sprites, audio, and preload pipeline |
| 3 | 3-4 days | Gravity, pipes, scoring, persistence |
| 4 | 2-3 days | Screens, VFX, audio system |
| 5 | 2-3 days | Menus, mobile UX, responsive layout |
| 6 | 2-3 days | Unit + e2e tests, perf optimisations |
| 7 | 1-2 days | Vercel pipeline, monitoring, analytics |

_Total estimate: 13-20 days._

## Success Criteria
• 60 FPS gameplay on desktop & mobile
• Responsive UI / touch controls
• ≤ 1 s first meaningful paint on production build
• Zero-error run in full test suite
• Successful Vercel deployment & custom domain
• Positive user feedback collected post-launch
